Summer 2023 Project for Sam's Club:

Create a more efficient method for Sam's Club cart pushers.

Problem: The current method to retrieve carts is a slow one. Customers walk in the store and carts are nowhere to be seen.
We need to come up with a solution.

Data Collection: I collected data over the following variables:

- How much time walking to each corral in the parking lot takes
- How efficient each employee is
- How busy we are at each hour of the day across multiple days, weeks, months, etc
- The amount of workers


Solution: Implementing a new "zoning method" by splitting the parking lot up into zones and assigning each
employee a zone will solve the cart problem. 

After implementing: We do not have any cart problems.
